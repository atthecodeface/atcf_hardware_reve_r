# Modules

riscv_i32_alu
-------------

riscv_i32_decode
----------------

riscv_i32c_decode
----------------

riscv_i32c_pipeline
----------------

* single stage execution pipeline (decode, fetch, execute)
* dmem_access_req valid during the cycle
* dmem_access_resp must be valid with read data at the end of the
cycle
* ifetch_req valid during the cycle
* ifetch_resp must be valid with read data at the end of the
cycle

riscv_i32c_minimal
----------------

* needs to be removed and changed to riscv_i32c_minimal
 * I/E32 instruction set + optionally compressed only (multiply etc
 disabled)
 * set riscv_config.i32c to 1 for RV32IC support
 * set riscv_config.i32c to 0 for no RV32IC support
 * set riscv_config.e32 to 1 for RV32E only (with/without C)
 * set riscv_config.e32 to 0 for no RV32E only (with/without C)
 * set riscv_config.i32m should be 0
 * minimal CSRs (machine mode only)
 * Includes:
   +  riscv_i32c_pipeline
